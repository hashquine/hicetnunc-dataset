    "[Hic et nunc](http://hicetnunc.xyz) is a new eco-friendly [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) marketplace, built on top of [Tezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tezos) blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is especially popular in generative graphics and data viz community, so I've decided to share data and all scripts that I've made for https://hashquine.github.io/hicetnunc rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is published under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license, so that it is even possible to sell NFTs that use that data (or modified scripts) as long as there is the following phrase somewhere in the token description: `based on @hashquine dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since hic et nunc servers are already under an extreme load due to quick growth, I've reorganized code, so that all data is taken from Tezos blockchain and IPFS **without any calls** to the [hicetnunc.xyz](http://hicetnunc.xyz) website or API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blockchain transactions by [TzStats API](https://tzstats.com/docs/api#tezos-api) ([better-call.dev](https://better-call.dev) was not used in order not to interfere with hicetnunc backend).\n",
    "* [IPFS](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPFS) by [cloudflare-ipfs.com](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/) and [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io/) depending on mime type (same sources as in hicetnunc frontend).\n",
    "* Wallet address owner metadata (name, Twitter etc.) from [api.tzkt.io](https://api.tzkt.io/#operation/Accounts_GetMetadata) (same source as in hicetnunc frontend).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What data is available\n",
    "\n",
    "* Money data: list of all purchases, prices and commissions.\n",
    "* All NFTs raw files, their previews and thumbnails, although 3d files and interactive SVG/HTML files are not yet processed properly.\n",
    "* Authors metadata [verified via tzkt.io](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/blob/main/FAQ.md#how-to-get-verified) like Twitter account address.\n",
    "* Token transfers: list of changes of tokens owners including burns and direct transfers.\n",
    "* All metadata available for tokens.\n",
    "* Swaps and mints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data not available:\n",
    "* Everything connected with [hDAO tokens](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-are-those-little-circles-on-each-post-hdao-what-is-that) and [hDAO feed](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/hdao). Although all related transactions are already being collected, they are not analysed yet.\n",
    "* Twitter statistics like the number of followers.\n",
    "* Direct money transfers between users, when NFT tokens are not transferred in the same transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset schema\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to simplify data analysis and visualization with a wide range of existing tools, so there are lots of redundant fields, which contain precalculated aggregations and different representations of the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All files have two equivalent versions: JSON and CSV.\n",
    "* JSON files are dictionary of dictionaries with rows of CSV files are indexed by the `*_id` field.\n",
    "* CSV files have commas as delimiters.\n",
    "* Fields values are ether numbers or strings, empty values represented by `-1` or `\"\"`.\n",
    "* All identifiers are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any field, which references some event in the blockchain (for example, mint time) have 4 representations:\n",
    "* `mint_iso_date` &mdash; string with UTC date and time: `\"2021-03-01T15:00:00Z\"`,\n",
    "* `mint_stamp` &mdash; integer Unix timestamp in seconds: `1614610800`,\n",
    "* `mint_hash` &mdash; string with transaction hash, where event occurred: `\"oom5Ju6X9nYpBCi...\"`,\n",
    "* `mint_row_id` &mdash; integer with global unique operation id (internal to TzStats) with that event: `42181049`\n",
    "\n",
    "Any field, which references a set of values (like the set of prices of sold works), have following aggregations:\n",
    "* `sold_count` &mdash; values count (excl. zeros),\n",
    "* `sold_zero_count` &mdash; number of zeros,\n",
    "* `sold_price_min` &mdash; minimum value (excl. zeros),\n",
    "* `sold_price_max` &mdash; maximum value,\n",
    "* `sold_price_sum` &mdash; sum of values,\n",
    "* `sold_price_avg` &mdash; average value (sum divided by count excl. zeros).\n"
